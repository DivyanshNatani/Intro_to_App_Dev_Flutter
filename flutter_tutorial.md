# Flutter Tutorial
There are various tutorial available on Internet on Introduction to Flutter and almost all of them provide a good start to Flutter. I like playlist by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ) as it explains everything important in great detail as well as keep it compact and fits everything in minimum time possible.

## Prerequise
Basic knowledge of UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) is always an asset for App Design. So, a basic experience of HTML/CSS (basically what all are the element and where to keep them) works for it.

Flutter uses Dart as language for design and logic. Dart is language developed by Google and is an object oriented programming language. It is easy to grasp and is has syntax simmilar to JS/Python/Java/C#. A basic CS101 knowledge is enough for learning Dart. Experience to JS(~40 min [crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)) is added advantage(not a pre-req).

## How should you go about it.

This playlist has 35 videos and it covers from basic to advance Widgets (Flutter is all about Widgets! you will know more about them in Video).

Detailed discription of Videos:
- Video 1-2 : Overview and Installation (16min)
- Video 3: **Introduction to Dart** (27min) : This video will cover basics of Dart. After this video, you will know how easy it is to pickup a language after doing CS101 (power of CS101!)
- Video 4-9 : Basic Widgets - Text, Image , Icons, Buttons and there styling
- Video 10-14 : Container Widgets, Rows and Column Widgets and there properties

This last app will give you most of basic features of flutter. I highly recommend to follow this playlist.

## Installation
Check this out for [detailed installation process](https://github.com/DivyanshNatani/Intro_to_App_Dev_Flutter/blob/main/installation.md)

__NOTE__ : Installation does not take much time when compared to time taken for downloading packages (specially android studio). So, a general advice, start [downloading Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) before watching the tutorial/starting the installation.

## Prerequise
Basic knowledge of UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) is always an asset for App Design. So, a basic experience of HTML/CSS (basically what all are the element and where to keep them) works for it.

Flutter uses Dart as language for design and logic. Dart is language developed by Google and is an object oriented programming language. It is easy to grasp and is has syntax simmilar to JS/Python/Java/C#. A basic CS101 knowledge is enough for learning Dart. Experience to JS(~40 min [crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)) is added advantage(not a pre-req).
